These scripts have been prepared for an x64 (64-bits) machine running 
Debian 8 ("jessie")

After installing on 64 bits, I have the following notes: 

Before starting, you should install using apt-get: 
gcc-multilib g++-multilib flex libncurses5-dev build-essential libgmp3-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libglu1-mesa-dev mesa-common-dev 


Problems with installation files: 
- HASKELL: works with Debian 8 or above, it requires GLIBC_2.14 or higher, Debian 7's version is 2.13

-OPAL: having problems with readline library 

-Stratego lacks enough information as the documentation where very old and not updated to be 
used with Spoofax like the following url: 
http://strategoxt.org/Spoofax/CommandLine 


Files that have not yet been fixed:  
-CADP
